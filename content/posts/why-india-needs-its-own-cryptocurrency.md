India is a country where cash circulation ammounts to whopping 5 lac crore rupees. With technologies like UPI and the tech boom, digital payments are on a stark rise📈.

The total global market cap in the world for cryptocurrencies is more than [2 trillion USD](https://coinmarketcap.com/) (It doubled in the last two months alone), **two-thirds of India's annual GDP** 🤯 this tells a lot! And our government is planning to ban the use of cryptocurrencies. Dodgecoin, a joke crossed 50 billion USD.

> India should launch its own cryptocurrency and back it with other cypto

Like we had gold, that backed other currencies, we should launch our own coin and back it with crptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.

# What are Cryptocurrencies

A cryptocurrency (or “crypto”) is kind of digital currency that can be used to buy goods and services or be traded with other currencies, but uses a public ledger (generally) with strong encryption and verification techniques to secure online transactions.

All the "transactions" are prepared as a block and are distributed across various computers {if [decentralised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization)) and everyone who is part of that chain has a copy of all the previous transactions.

Crypto can massively help in cross border payments as it is Peer-to-peer and does not require any centralised authority to verify that. Instead all the members of the chain can verify the transactions and are rewarded with a piece of the pie for their work - called mining. As of now _most_ popular crptocurrencies are based on this fundnamental principle.

# Why India can't "ban" crypto

1. It is not feasable to ban as anyone can very easily hold massive ammounts of wealth in crypto \[pseudo-anonymously\] all secured with a long passphrase
2. A lot of startups, researchers, founder would leave India if they are restricted
3. We will lose our stance in world politics. As other countries will be launching their own such currencies. [China](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-creates-its-own-digital-currency-a-first-for-major-economy-11617634118) is alredy in advanced stages and UK just announed they are [considering launching](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/978531/Final_CBDC_Taskforce_ToR.pdf) their own [Central Bank Digital Currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank_digital_currency) (CBDC).

# Digital Rupee

The [recently intriduced bill](https://www.prsindia.org/billtrack/draft-banning-cryptocurrency-regulation-official-digital-currency-bill-2019) proposes a ban of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in favor of a digital rupee on the grounds of protecting India's national security. But it is kind of counter-intuitive.

## Advantages of a digital rupee

**Fight Fraud and Corruption**

A lot of Government expense is done in the field of interests and subsidy along with massive frauds in PMAY MGNREGA and other rural schemes. Along with that it is undeniable fact that farmer subsidies are also not used properly.

With help of cryptocurrencies we can "program" it. For ex. some money is given to farmer to be used for seeds, fertilizers etc., this might not be used for its intended cause and fraud might happen. If we can cryptographically make it so that that coin issued to the farmer is only valid if used for purchased of agro-products a lot of fraud can be avoided.  
These "smart contracts" are faster, cheaper, and more efficient than traditional contracts and auditing methods. All of these contracts can be fulfilled and authorized automatically.

**Can prevent social deplatformation**

The president of United States was [deplatformed ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/16/how-twitter-banned-trump/)from Twitter Facebook and also Youtube (partially) Even though we have restricted several chineese services like TikTok US still has power to easily block social media access to our leaders and important organizations especially in case of emergency. If we have a platform that runs on say Ethereum network then it is not possible for a single entity to deplatform a user, without majority saying so.   
It also paves path for serveral startups to take advantage of this and create such netural platforms. 

**Prevent financial deplatforming**

Not only is just internet communication at risk but so is financial systems. [SWIFT](https://qz.com/1893235/swift-transfer-system-leaves-china-vulnerable-to-us-sanctions/), PayPal, or Google Pay are all US controlled institutions and with US oversight it is possible for it to stop grants and trade going through SWIFT. Enforcing the need of a digital rupee based on other decentralized crypto.

**Trust**

If all government purchases and trasactions including donations are made to be publically visible it can give trust to the citizens and also counter massive corruption. Transperency is key for a stable and trusted government. Although most politicians might not favour this as it can backfire themselves only.  
But it is definitely a way to give trust in goernment funds and efforts like [PMCares](https://www.pmcares.gov.in/en/).

**Accounting**

With every transation and rupee being tracable and easily indexable, accounting can become super easy and transperent.

## Why back it with crypto

Let us consider we go in a big fat war. Our currency becomes devalued with infrastructure dying out. Hyper-inflation is already ruining lives. How can you solve it?  
**_Using a economic platform that is above governments_**

RBI can easily freeze accounts and transfer and print money but crpto like Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralalized non-nationalized global currencies.  
Like countries hold massive reserves of gold to counter inflation and devaluation of currency. Holding the next rare resource (Bitcoin) is like a failsafe for our economy - _a_ _hedge against inflation._

There won't be more than 21 million Bitcoin in existance and difficulty for mining will always increase, making it impossible to reach that full circulation. Because BTC is limited (and also the first one) it acts like gold for cryptocurrencies.
