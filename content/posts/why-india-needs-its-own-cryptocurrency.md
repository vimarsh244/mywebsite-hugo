India is a country where cash circulation ammounts to whopping 5 lac crore rupees. With technologies like UPI and the tech boom, digital payments are on a stark riseüìà.

The total global market cap in the world for cryptocurrencies is [cuyrrently 2 trillion USD](https://coinmarketcap.com/) (It doubled in the last two months alone), **two-thirds of India's annual GDP** ü§Ø this tells a lot! And our government is planning to ban the use of cryptocurrencies. Dodgecoin, a joke crossed 50 billion USD. 

> India should launch its own cryptocurrency and back it with other cypto

Like we had gold, that backed other currencies, we should launch our own coin and back it with crptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.

# What are Cryptocurrencies

A cryptocurrency (or ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù) is kind of digital currency that can be used to buy goods and services or be traded with other currencies, but uses a public ledger (generally) with strong encryption and verification techniques to secure online transactions.

All the "transactions" are prepared as a block and are distributed across various computers {if [decentralised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization)) and everyone who is part of that chain has a copy of all the previous transactions.

Crypto can massively help in cross border payments as it is Peer-to-peer and does not require any centralised authority to verify that. Instead all the members of the chain can verify the transactions and are rewarded with a piece of the pie for their work called mining. As of now most popular crptocurrencies are based on this fundnamental principle.
