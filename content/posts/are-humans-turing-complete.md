**What are Turing Machines?**

A turing machine developed by Alan Turing is considered as the most basic form of Computer which can be simlutated to replicate its logic .

In theory, a Turing machine consists of an infinite tape and a tape head. The tape consists of infinitely many squares, where every square is eighther empty or stores a symbol. The tape head is an active component that: reads the symbol on the square, follows a set of rules to determine whether to change the symbol on the square, determines whether to move left or right, and repeats this procedure until the outcome of the rules says it should halt.

[Turing completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness "Turing completeness") is the ability for a system of instructions to simulate a Turing machine. Almost all programming languages are Turing complete if the limitations of finite memory are ignored.
