In today's era of social media, where we come across hate comments every single day through social media, it's quite evident that intolerance is a matter of concern in today's generation.

One of the primary reason behind this attitude of getting affected at the smallest of things is because of the insecurity and vulnerability that we have developed, as the current generation tends to easily idolize people and things and follow them blindly (so called "Bhakts"), without having their own rationale, and to keep themselves away from contradicting their own ideologies is to be ignorant of other; and that makes them vulnerable to get easily affected by anything beyond their bubble, thus giving rise to intolerance!
