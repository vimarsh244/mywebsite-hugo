Over our lifespans, we consume lots of goods, energy, time, empathy of others, etc  
So all that consumption we do is valuable? Am i creating enough value for others, familym friends, world; to justify the resources of mother earth i am eating up.



I am not telling you are being useless; but to reflect upon yourself and realize how much resources that are being consumed are actually creating any value for you or your surroundings?  
We should be mindful of our activities and mindless consumerism to realise how much weight I am on the world.
