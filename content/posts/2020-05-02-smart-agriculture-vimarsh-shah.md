Smart Agriculture Project uses agricultural robot based on machine learning to address three main&nbsp;issues

1) Over watering,
2) Early identification of plant diseases; and
3) Efficient monitoring of farms.

In agriculture fields, lack of proper monitoring results in low yields and unpredictable revenue. Lack of early detection of crop diseases, destroys the plants and do not leave enough time to take preventive measures. In India, 30% of crops are destroyed due to plant diseases and almost 50% water is wasted due to over watering.

This solution uses machine learning algorithms, camera and 7 different sensors to monitor the fields, automate the watering of plants and detect 19 different types of crop diseases.

Along with that it uses historical data like irrigation, which crop is planted,etc to predict which crop is most suitable for the agricultural field.
