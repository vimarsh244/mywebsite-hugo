You do not need to pay for that service, as the basic needs are already satisfied by (non-human destructing) robots.\nWhat will these robots do? They will be following these rules:\nIsaac Asimov‚Äôs ‚ÄúThree Laws of Robotics‚Äù\n A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.  These robots along with automatic basic processes will manage finance (Currency will be irrelevant) and World problems. They will be collectively instructed by us to focus on a common goal. Let us not consider any Skynet ‚Äì Terminator arising.\nWhat will humans do? Most humans will have nothing to do forcefully; they will have lots of time to pursue their passion and explore the world and other hobbies that they always wanted to. Spending time with friends and family will become very ubiquitous with life as there won‚Äôt be any reason to do specialized white/blue-collar jobs.\nSome people just would like to be C Executives, business people, scientists, photographers etc‚Ä¶ and they can be that. From managing small robotic corporations, to researching on increasing human life span, space exploration, liberal arts, music, etc will require a human element and an intelligence ‚Äì difficult to attain.\nThere will also be a demand for human element, the restaurant example comes here. Hospitality industry will still go on, after all, humans are inherently social beings.\nComparison\nHumans always like to compare themselves to someone else or their own future-self, which might be wrong but evolution has made us do that. To grow and show our domination __over others, we always compared and tried to better than the everyone else. Thus, comparing is built into the minds of humans.\nWith extensive advancements in healthcare, most people will be living a life of same age: making time an irrelevant comparison. Land will still remain a limited resource, even with people wanting to explore other planets and galaxies. Which by-born capitalists would love to fund.\nBut Why? Why to imagine such a scenario?\nPondering upon the thoughts of robots doing all the work, we need to realise:\n What is the source of happiness in our lives.\n Most people are rabbits in the rat race. We as humans (mostly) do not understand (or think) why are we doing a task.

<p><strong>Why to imagine such a scenario?</strong></p>
<p>Pondering upon the thoughts of robots doing all the work, we need to realise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the source of happiness in our lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most people are rabbits in the rat race. We as humans (mostly) do not understand (or think) why are we doing a task. Some might be required responsibilities, which will still be present in the ‚Äúutopia‚Äù; but for the other major part we need to question ourselves and try to find happiness and meaning in life.</p>
<p><em>If from tomorrow you do not need to do any work ‚Äì what will you do?</em>
Playing Games, Meditating, travelling the world, we need to find such passions we can follow and explore. It can last our lifetimes: exploring various fields. The need for human connection will set forth new jobs and hobbies.<br>
People will start thinking about afterlife, be conscious and conscient for their decisions and would seek enlightenment.</p>
<p><strong>A Signature</strong></p>
<p>There is a saying that goes by</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Non omnis moriar</strong>
(<em>Not all of me will die</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people would just want to live their lives. Whereas, others will want to leave behind their own unique signature. An art piece, a book, a picture‚Ä¶ anything. Even their wisdom (if mind storage becomes possible). This will remain engraved and hopefully permanent for years and centuries to come.</p>
<p><strong>My thoughts</strong></p>
<p>I would personally enjoy such distant utopia; where I can work on and do things I truly care about. Like, knowing about our past, and gaining as much wisdom and knowledge as I can. That would bring happiness to me. I would also like to work on space explorationüöÄüåïüåë like many would.<br>
