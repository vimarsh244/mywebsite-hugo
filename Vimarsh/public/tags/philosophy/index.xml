      <description>If robots do all the work, there won’t be any scarcity of human manpower, food, shelter and basic needs and most wants. Most people will have nothing to do, or will they?
Imagine you go to a restaurant owned by a human in that Utopia. They might be making meals and serving people because they like to do that. You do not need to pay for that service, as the basic needs are already satisfied by (non-human destructing) robots.</description>
