      <description>I have recently observed and felt that, we the children and Youth, in order to fit into a certain designed parameters often leave behind the essence of individuality. We often leave behind our unique characteristic which make us a different person and an “Individual”.
Recently I have observed that, Groupism is at its peak especially among school cultures: say you don’t like a particular thing or do not have an interest in a matter / subject – you are left out.</description>
