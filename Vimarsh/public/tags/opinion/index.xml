      <description>If robots do all the work, there won‚Äôt be any scarcity of human manpower, food, shelter and basic needs and most wants. Most people will have nothing to do, or will they?

      <description>I have recently observed and felt that, we the children and Youth, in order to fit into a certain designed parameters often leave behind the essence of individuality. We often leave behind our unique characteristic which make us a different person and an ‚ÄúIndividual‚Äù.
Recently I have observed that, Groupism is at its peak especially among school cultures: say you don‚Äôt like a particular thing or do not have an interest in a matter / subject ‚Äì you are left out.</description>
