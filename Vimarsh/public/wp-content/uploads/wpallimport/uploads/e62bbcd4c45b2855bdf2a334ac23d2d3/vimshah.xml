He can then control and spy on people and much more.</p><p>Is this all even realistic and possible? Are we in a new war where 1s and 0s are firing through fiber cables toppling governments??</p><p>Are we in a cyber warfare without even realizing it?</p><p>Actually, we might just (partially) be in one.</p><p>When people think about hacking, they think about filibustering some secret information, or accessing government secrets, spying on people, etc. But the true power of hacking is in the control of people’s mind and thoughts.</p><p>The perception of reality and facts itself might just change through tactics employed by hackers. This is being done and will be done with spreading of fake news, obfuscation and jumbling of facts, misinterpretation and more.</p><p>These conflicts also happenned in 2016 US presidential election resulting in massive fluctuations of votes and in 2020 with President, inciting violence and subsequent attack on Capitol.</p><p>Advancements in AI and Natural Language Processing are definitely being used to guess passwords, infect phones and computers with malware and are harvesting data.

The comments under US presidential twitter handles during election itself tells the whole plot.</p><p>Hence, it is safe to say that wars in future will be fought out of plain sight from anywhere anytime across the globe. Misinformation, malicious code, and exploiting of use of social media for national communication will be the battlegrounds of the future, resulting in massive conflicts of interest and stroke to fundamentals of democracy in many countries.</p><p>And if we are already at war, then when should we start reckoning the first explosions.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=c60b02872f64" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Homeopathy — Health or Hoax</h3><p>A scam that actually (kind of) works!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*XRC71p2XI3rfyRWi" /><figcaption><a href="https://healthimpactnews.com/2015/is-the-fda-getting-ready-to-ban-homeopathy/">Source for image</a></figcaption></figure><p>Homeopathy — all of us might have heard about it. It is a very famous alternate form of allopathic (<em>normal </em>— as we define it) medication; in the same category as the like of Ayurveda. People mostly argue that it is “fake” and scientifically baseless, while there are some people who I personally know who praise its effectiveness and say it is very effective.</p><p>This raises the Question — <strong>Is Homeopathy real?</strong></p><p>Except the medications it might just be real!</p><p>First a little on the history of Homeopathy and what <em>they </em>claim it actually is…</p><p>Homeopathy’s roots emerge from the findings, teachings and writings of Dr. Samuel Hahnemann (1755–1843). After starting his own medical practice he started experimenting with the Homeopathic treatment as he did not believe in the medicine of the time and was disenchanted by it.</p><h3>How it works</h3><p>Homeopathy is fundamentally based on following main principles:</p><ul><li><strong>The cornerstone principle <br></strong>Homeopathy actually derives its name from the Greek, homoeo= ‘similar’, and pathos= ‘suffering’. <br>Basically, A substance that can induce particular symptoms in healthy people, can also cure a sick person facing the same symptoms due to any disease, when given in small quantities.<br>This might seem similar to how vaccines seem to work; but unlike vaccines where generally weakened germs are injected, homeopathy believed in giving any material that cause similar symptoms, even tho it has absolutely ZERO correlation between it.</li><li><strong>A Single Remedy</strong><br>Another principle is that at a time only one remedy can be given. <em>Otherwise, the response would be unpredictable and ambiguous, </em>they think. <br>Considering that those Expensive 💰💰medications need to be taken for a very long time, one cannot say if this is just an 🏧ATM for the “doctors”. <br>Also this is given in small dozes to prevent side-effects and maximize its efficacy.</li><li><strong>Potentization<br></strong>The Homeopathic remedies that are made from plants, flowers, minerals, etc. are manufactured unlike anything else. They are diluted to such a massive extent that there are probably only a few hundred molecules of the medications in the entire 30C diluted vile.<br>This extreme dilution makes the medication ineffective in all practical sense.</li><li><strong>Water has Memory </strong>🤯<br>Homeopaths use extreme potency as discussed earlier this means there is absolutely NO original molecules (statistically). So, the homeopaths say that water has memory of its source and how it is “brewed” — which is and does sound extremely absurd and surreal.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gZdDT3qVjmplps29rHPwhA.jpeg" /><figcaption>Think about it — “Water has memory” 😆</figcaption></figure><p>Scientifically Homeopathy can solve the following problems:</p><ol><li>…. basically none.</li></ol><p>If you want you can just read this Wikipedia page citing 1000s of studies showing the inefficacy of Homeopathic “medicines” : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_and_efficacy_of_homeopathy">Evidence and efficacy of homeopathy — Wikipedia</a></p><p>The thing is so absurd, that the <a href="https://advocacy.sba.gov/2020/01/27/homeopathy-industry-threatened-by-new-fda-guidance/">FDA was planning to ban</a> the practicing of Homeopathy!</p><p>The sugar balls in which they add that 2 drops of water might make you more diabetic, instead of helping.</p><h3>It Still Works</h3><p>As I mentioned, scientifically the medications and the whole “Homeopathy” is just a big scam, promising that the “medicines” will cure genetic disease or cancer and stuff! <em>Which FYI it doesn’t.</em></p><p>But we still hear about people getting cured for some diseases, so HOW?<br>How can people swear by its greatness and effectiveness? Is it the biggest alternative to scientific medicine?</p><p>It is due to the <strong>Placebo Effect. </strong>Most people that get the Homeopathic medication believe that it works and those water coated sugar balls will cure them. Because, they believe in it and the time of medication is over period of months. Believing that they will be cured trains their minds and their body heals innately.</p><p>Even if they know that the medicines are a scam, it works &amp; it works well, There is this really interesting experiment / video by Vsause and a definite watch on the topic of Placebo and its real world effects.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FQDCcuCHOIyY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DQDCcuCHOIyY&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FQDCcuCHOIyY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/be6b30005ba3285cc97ec5e11c8d0741/href">https://medium.com/media/be6b30005ba3285cc97ec5e11c8d0741/href</a></iframe><h3>Another thought 💭</h3><p>Another reason, why Homeopathy is still effective is also because of the doctors… In the current medical world, most doctors are profit driven and try to maximize their number of patients. On the other hand, homeopathic doctors talk with the patient very calmly, try to understand them and give mental support.</p><p>These frequent conversations that also motivate the patient; helps him/her in overcoming the disease.</p><p>But, about me: I still believe its a scam, and you should not believe in it. Also the prizes they charge for water and plastic containers are exorbitant and should not be done!</p><p>In the end, giving empathy &amp; hope to patients is good but the simple fact is that- “<strong>Sugar pills can never cure cancer”. </strong><em>at least not yet</em>🤣</p><p>— <a href="http://www.vimarsh.info">Vimarsh Shah</a></p><h4>References and Sources</h4><p><a href="http://www.wholehealthnow.com/homeopathy_info/history.html">History of Homeopathy (wholehealthnow.com)</a><br><a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/homeopathy">Homeopathy | NCCIH (nih.gov)</a><br><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,,-9542,00.html">Is there any proof that homeopathic medicine works? | Notes and Queries | guardian.co.uk (theguardian.com)</a><br><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/03/11/no-evidence-homeopathy-is-any-better-than-a-placebo-major-australian-study-says/">No evidence homeopathy is any better than a placebo, major Australian study says — The Washington Post</a></p><p>Thanks to my friend <a href="https://aryantiwari.com/">Aryan</a> for helping me edit the post.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ec0d4e7b6af4" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

Unlike in the past when the animals were stuffed into cramped cages, modern zoos provide a vast amount of space and create an artificial natural habitat specific to that particular species. Thus simulating the wild ecosystem. This is not just because the zoo managers felt pity for animals but mainly because it has a higher viewer attraction and provides <em>better pictures.</em></p><p>The evolution of zoos also stemmed from Organizations like <a href="https://www.aza.org/about-us">Association of Zoos and Aquariums</a> (AZA) in North America and <a href="http://www.cza.nic.in/?source_utm=vimarsh.info">Central Zoo Authority</a> in India.

Also, by being in zoos, authorities are able to raise money for survival of these Endangered Species.</p><h3>Reintroduction Programs</h3><p>The goal of reintroduction programs is to release animals that have been raised or rehabilitated in zoos back into their natural habitats.</p><h3>International Collaborations</h3><p>There are also international programs conducted outside the animal’s usual habitat where similar genetic matches are found by experts to help the species from going extinct.</p><p>Species such as the golden lion tamarin, Arabian oryx, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120212234213/http://www.zsl.org/info/media/press-releases/null,1790,PR.html">Przewalski’s horse</a>, the European bison, and even the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/earthnews/3353370/Dormice-breed-successfully-in-the-wild.html">common dormouse</a> have at some point been <a href="http://www.biaza.org.uk/uploads/Committees/FPC/BIAZA_Top10summary_FINAL.pdf">reliant upon captive breeding</a> so as to not become as dead as the Dodo.</p><h3>Few Species Saved From Extinction by Zoos</h3><p><a href="https://taronga.org.au/news/2017-05-22/10-endangered-species-saved-extinction-zoos"><em>Source: Taronga Conservation Society Australia</em></a><br>Entire Credit goes to the above source for this part</p><ul><li><strong>Arabian Oryx:</strong> Hunted to extinction in the wild, the Arabian Oryx was revitalized thanks to conservation efforts of Phoenix Zoo and others.

Reintroduction efforts are underway for six of these species, including the </em><a href="http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/factsheet/22706052"><em>Hawaiian crow</em></a><em>. According to the IUCN, conservation breeding and reintroduction have helped prevent the extinction of six out of 16 critically endangered bird species and nine out of 13 mammal species, including species previously classified as “Extinct in the Wild.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.treehugger.com/zoos-and-endangered-species-conservation-1182068"><em>The Role of Zoos in Endangered Species Conservation (treehugger.com)</em></a></blockquote><p>Some of the recently published studies do support the fact that establishing zoos have helped animals.</p><h3>Opinion</h3><p>Although there are some cases where these restoration efforts are hugely missing/absent, a particular species of Vulture in Polo Forest (Gujarat) had only around 350 of them left, which are still decreasing. These vultures are trained by locals to perform tasks and entertain visitors. But staying away from their natural habitat is hence, decreasing their numbers in the wild.</p><p><em>There might be even more such species going endangered but I know of this one being visited the place.</em></p><p>Also, In India a lot of zoos are located in cities. Along with dangerous quantities of noise that visitors make, even during night, it is very difficult for these animals to have proper sleep, thus, degrading their health.</p><p>India’s participation in International Collaborations has been bleak (or has not been published anywhere) and the number of National Conferences held are also extremely few: <a href="http://cza.nic.in/uploads/documents/capacitybuilding.pdf">capacitybuilding.pdf (cza.nic.in)</a></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Also Lots of Zoo owners across the globe are just profit driven and there still exist zoos with terrible living conditions for the animals. But it is also not denied that zoos have <em>not </em>helped in Animal Conservation.</p><p>There should be a dedicated NGO certification, which certifies that the zoo provides required habitat for the animals, proper food and hygiene and also collaboration to preserve the species. After all Endangered animals in zoos are probably more safe than in the wild where they are captured and killed to be sold in black market.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*viO1cJFwJzxabq8r.jpeg" /></figure><p><strong>Sources:</strong></p><p>Images from Wikipedia, TravelTriangle and Unsplash.</p><p><em>Originally published on January 12, 2021.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ccc766a5fbd3" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/0*MIzKK0NwLK9axNU3.jpg" /></figure><p>DuckDuckGo is a privacy-focused search engine that claims it does not track its users and provides organic search results and ads that are not personalized to you. This is my experience of using DuckDuckGo exclusively for almost a month.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*hlFlm6t0yOZ6nWh0" /></figure><p>According to their own homepage:</p><blockquote><em>We don’t store your personal info. We don’t follow you around with ads. We don’t track you. Ever.</em></blockquote><h3>The Filter Bubble</h3><p>Apart from all the privacy features, another big claim by DDG is that it helps you escape the “filter bubble”; which essentially means that Google and other similar search engines (like Bing, Yahoo) bring massively different search results for different users, even though the query is exactly the same.</p><p><a href="https://fs.blog/2017/07/filter-bubbles/">An Interesting read on the topic</a></p><p>This provides the user all the relevant organic search results and leaves up to the user to form their opinion on a particular topic; whereas on Google you slowly dig up a rabbit hole for yourself and get results on part of the topic which <strong>Google thinks you feel is correct</strong>.</p><p>This makes DDG a really useful tool for doing organic research.</p><h3>My Experience using DuckDuckGo</h3><h4>Customization</h4><p>I really like the granular control that DDG provides on customization. You can have Dark Mode, Light Mode, and more themes,</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/990/0*IBozBvRR-VDrSleS" /></figure><p>customize how results appear, Fonts and Color of literally everything, and also you can entirely disable Advertisements!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/909/0*tpmWiNIDd6oOr0rS" /></figure><h4>The search Results</h4><p>Based on my experience using DDG, I didn’t find search results to be extremely bad; they were as good as or slightly worse than that of Google. Although sometimes they were slightly better I felt, probably because Google thought I might want a different answer?</p><p>Although I was really happy with the reduction in the number of ads I was meant to deal with.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Y8Rnt7wZxlXF4Aw2" /><figcaption>Search results on Google.. the whole page is ads</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ks90p0C9yNe5blbB" /><figcaption>This is DDG, ngl there are advertisements but on homepage itself there are organic comparisons too.</figcaption></figure><p>On Google instead of getting a comparison from various sources, the whole page was just ADS; compared to DDG which <em>also</em> gave some comparison websites.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The ads served by DDG are private (means DDG cannot tie it to your profile) but DDG explicitly mentions that when you leave their website by clicking their ads (which are managed by Microsoft) then MSFT can track your IP, Fingerprints on web and more. <a href="https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/company/advertising-and-affiliates/">Read More</a></p><h4>Experience on Mobile📱</h4><p>The experience on Mobile was <em>fine</em>. Because of the location permission constraints, some queries gave very weird answers, but it does work for quick searches</p><h4>The DuckDuckGo extension</h4><p>DDG also has a Chrome/Firefox extension that blocks trackers and ads, but my experience with it was slow, it took a long time to load a page and blocking didn’t seem to work every time. Other such extensions work way better and are more responsive.</p><h3>Should you switch?</h3><p><strong>YES</strong> 👍</p><p>Except for some little quirks on mobile, DDG is a really good Search Engine (and also a very powerful search tool with the use of bangs). And according to me, as people become more extremist on a political/social topic, being provided organic search results is essential.</p><p>With less obstructive Ads, getting almost similar search results to Google, it’s a no-brainer.</p><p>Although I will be covering Video and News search along with <em>!bangs</em> in a later post which is not as good.</p><p>Credit to <a href="http://aryantiwari.com/">Aryan Tiwari</a> for helping in editing this post.</p><p><em>Originally published on January 5, 2021.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=13ef4b149b87" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

The curriculum in 🏫is generally pretty outdated and not fun to learn… Resigning it with modern information and methods of learning is essential for developing an inspiration to write on it explore more about it or starting a podcast 🎤or something.</p><p>Discussion and healthy debates are also some of the most important aspects of a classroom… But with vast amounts of the syllabus to cover it’s extremely difficult to have ANY kind of healthy discussions with teachers and fellow peers on a particular topic.</p><p>There should be more application-based learning. Rather than just learn the concepts 📚 and figure out what to do, students should be given projects and encouragement to apply the concepts that they have learned into real-world🗺️ use cases!</p><h3>What I think should be done</h3><blockquote><em>This is also more of what I think should be done from class 9/10 onwards</em></blockquote><p>The curriculum that is taught should be more focused. Rather than bombarding students with all the concepts, they should have the option to focus on just one subtopic for an entire year. (Example — Instead of learning everything in Maths in Class 11 and 12 there should be an option to just learn Geometry the entire year and be thorough in it)</p><p>A lot of assignments and research-based projects should be given and have a higher priority to engross the student in learning about the topic more and its applications⚙.</p><p>The mentality of people that their students need to learn a lot of things practice 50 Million Questions to get into good universities needs to go, and the Universities should also be encouraging students to focus on doing research and be good at a field they are pursuing.</p><p>Healthy Debates among students along with teachers is also essential along with regular quizzes and current world scenario-based discussions.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The Education Industry does hamper students’ creativity. With a lot of syllabus to complete and <em>50 thousand questions</em> that need to be completed, the student does not get enough time to work on a particular subject that fascinates the student.</p><p>He/She doesn’t hence feel the need to do further research and enjoy the learning process, but rather score marks.</p><p>This makes it very difficult to get that inspiration to learn anything, and if learning is boring then a hobby, writing stories/poems, a new project, or a podcast is just too <strong>non-fulfilling</strong> for them.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*DC7kEgn9RjstGD5a" /></figure><p><em>Originally published on January 3, 2021.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=54b1830a527a" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>
