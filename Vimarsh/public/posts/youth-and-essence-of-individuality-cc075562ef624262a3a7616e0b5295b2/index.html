<p>Depicting Individuality – A red flower in a field of Yellow Flower | Image by Rupert Britton</p>
<p>I have recently observed and felt that, we the children and Youth, in order to fit into a certain designed parameters often leave behind the essence of individuality. We often leave behind our unique characteristic which make us a different person and an “Individual”.Recently I have observed that, Groupism is at its peak especially among school cultures: say you don’t like a particular thing or do not have an interest in a matter / subject – you are left out. You (and also many others) are considered different and to be with your “friends” and protect our individuality <em>we bend our interests to suit that group</em>.</p>
<p>Whenever you visit a stadium, a concert or a movie – you often are sitting with people with similar interests. Watching a cricket match</p>
<p>with someone you didn’t know half and hour ago seems like a good old friend: as if you were bonded together in a very unenvying invisible way. Looking at trends in tickets, consumer goods, we often find that people are searching for a commitment to buy/use emotionally rather than judging its functionality.</p>

<p>This if you realise, is changing. People are now driven to learn new things, explore their interests</p>
<p><em>based on what others do</em></p>
