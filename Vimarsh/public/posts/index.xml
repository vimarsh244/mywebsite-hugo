      <description>What is Deceit? WikipediaMost people expect their conversations with their close friends, family members and other strangers to be frank and honest. We feel like we are entitled to know about everything, even minute details. This enables there to trust in the other one you are talking to.

      <description>If robots do all the work, there won‚Äôt be any scarcity of human manpower, food, shelter and basic needs and most wants. Most people will have nothing to do, or will they?
Imagine you go to a restaurant owned by a human in that Utopia. They might be making meals and serving people because they like to do that. You do not need to pay for that service, as the basic needs are already satisfied by (non-human destructing) robots.</description>

      <description>I have recently observed and felt that, we the children and Youth, in order to fit into a certain designed parameters often leave behind the essence of individuality. We often leave behind our unique characteristic which make us a different person and an ‚ÄúIndividual‚Äù.
Recently I have observed that, Groupism is at its peak especially among school cultures: say you don‚Äôt like a particular thing or do not have an interest in a matter / subject ‚Äì you are left out.</description>

      <description>The new farm laws promise to 2x yes you read that correctly the income{.rank-math-link} of farmers in the next 2 years by relying on the deregulation of the market.

      <description>Bots once built to brute force and gain access to accounts are now being used to create posts and comments on public forums and social¬†media.
Below is my speech I spoke on for English Speaking Skills¬†test.
We have all seen in movies, that a guy with a hood in a dark room, rummaging the keyboard, presses Enter and whole internet is down. He can then control and spy on people and much¬†more.</description>

      <description>A scam that actually (kind of)¬†works!
Homeopathy‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall of us might have heard about it. It is a very famous alternate form of allopathic (_normal‚Ää_‚Äî‚Ääas we define it) medication; in the same category as the like of Ayurveda. People mostly argue that it is ‚Äúfake‚Äù and scientifically baseless, while there are some people who I personally know who praise its effectiveness and say it is very effective.</description>

      <description>DuckDuckGo is a privacy-focused search engine that claims it does not track its users and provides organic search results and ads that are not personalized to you. This is my experience of using DuckDuckGo exclusively for almost a¬†month.According to their own homepage:
The Filter¬†Bubble Apart from all the privacy features, another big claim by DDG is that it helps you escape the ‚Äúfilter bubble‚Äù; which essentially means that Google and other similar search engines (like Bing, Yahoo) bring massively different search results for different users, even though the query is exactly the¬†same.</description>

What exactly is Inspiration?
anything that drives one to do, create, endeavor, begin or develop some pursuit, skill, art or start with a fire or do something creative

      <description>Smart Agriculture Project uses agricultural robot based on machine learning to address three main¬†issues
  Over watering,
  Early identification of plant diseases¬†and
  Efficient monitoring of¬†farms.  In agriculture fields, lack of proper monitoring results in low yields and unpredictable revenue. Lack of early detection of crop diseases, destroys the plants and do not leave enough time to take preventive measures. In India, 30% of crops are destroyed due to plant diseases and almost 50% water is wasted due to over watering.</description>
